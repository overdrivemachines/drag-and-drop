# DRAG AND DROP

- Keep track of Tasks
- Divided into columns: Backlog, In Progress, Complete, On Hold
- Tasks in each column need to be able to be moved between columns and edited
- Main goal of this project is to showcase the drag and drop API. It allows us to drag and drop any html element and move it inside another html element
